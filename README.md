# Hogar Bazaar

Hogar Bazaar is an online marketplace for home goods that is designed to provide users with a platform to buy, sell or trade new, old or custom made items.

The platform has been built using the NodeJS Express framework, with a user-friendly interface created using Bootstrap. Additionally, the application uses Passport.js for authentication, providing users with a secure login and registration process.

Users of Hogar Bazaar can browse, purchase, sell and trade a wide range of home goods, including furniture, decor, and other household items. The platform is designed to be easy to use, with a search function and filters that allow users to quickly and easily find the items they are looking for.

For sellers, the platform provides a simple way to list items for sale, with the ability to add photos, descriptions and pricing information. Users can also view their sales and earnings history, as well as manage their listings and inventory.
